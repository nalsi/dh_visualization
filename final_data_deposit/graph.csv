In another step, the most frequent words used within a topic cluster are extracted and provided as labels to the left of the blocks representing topic clusters. As can be seen, at the beginning of the arbitration, there are fewer significant topic clusters, mostly related to the capacity of S21, environmental and security issues. Toward the end of the arbitration, a longer discussion with clearer topical focus evolved. The high costs of the project, which are the main issue, become more prominent, indicated by terms like Milliarden ‘billions’, Kostenkalkulation ‘cost accounting’, Euro, Risikopuffer ‘risk buffer’, Millionen ‘millions’, Preissteigerung ‘price hike’, Preise ‘prices’, Finanzierung ‘funding’, Geld ‘money’, or Kosten ‘costs’."

The traditional Franciscan saints Francis (0.0) and Clara (0.63) also yield significantly lower values because of their popularity outside the set of Franciscan calendars.

Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-683,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-683-fig1,"Processes that exhibit anti-persistent (a–c), short memory (d–f), and persistent (g–i) behavior. Left to right shows noise-like processes (a, d, and g), random walks obtained from the noise-like processes (b, e, and h), and, finally, estimation of the Hurst exponent for matching process (c, f, and i). Many cultural processes are noise-like (a, d, and g), but to estimate the Hurst exponent it is necessary to transform them to random walks through first-order integration (see Appendix A, equation (4)). In most cases, we are therefore not studying the process directly, but its incremental structure (b, e, and h). The behavior of the process (anti-persistent, short-term, and persistent) can often be observed at the initial plot (a, d, and g). The anti-persistent process (a) oscillates rapidly around its average at F(X) = 0, and short-memory process (b) contains short wave-like spikes. The persistent process (c) on the other hand contains copies of itself across multiple timescales. The last feature is an expression of self-similarity, which becomes more apparent for the persistent random walk process (h), where rounded mountain-like structures are embedded in the process at short, medium, and long timescales. The degree of self-similarity in a process can be estimated by AFA (c, f, and i) (see Appendix A, equations (5–6)), where a line is fitted to the residuals F(w) of the detrended process over multiple timescales or windows w. The Hurst parameter H is estimated as the slope of the linear fit and describes how fast the overall average amplitude F(w) grows with increasing window size w. For the anti-persistent process, the slope <0.5, for the process with only short-range correlations (i.e. short memory), it is approximately 0.5, and for the persistent process, the slope is >0.5. Notice that a linear fit is not a very accurate description of the anti-persistent process (c), which at short timescales (w < 16) is steeper, while at longer timescale (w ≥16) is more flat. This is an indication of a multi-fractal process. In this example, the process still remains anti-persistent because the slope is <0.5 at both timescales"

Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988-fig4,"While nearly every word in the 100 most frequent words occurs in every text, differences are more pronounced in the tail of the most frequent word vector. Novellas containing many words in the tail are affected by an increased dimensionality."
Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988-fig5,"Names make up twenty-seven of the thirty-four words removed by 20% culling. Three of the other seven are Baron, Gräfin, and Marquis. These titles are present each in fifteen or sixteen of the eighty-six novellas and therefore close to the cutoff, which they pass if combined. A similar situation arises for the three most common names. While there may be substantive reasons such as a genre signal to combine noble titles, this is not expected to be equally meaningful for character names. (a) Baron, Gräfin, and Marquis; (b) Marie, Müller, and Paul."
Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988-fig6,"We plot the mean tf- and tf-idf-score over all novellas. We observe the well-established Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1935, 1949) for the tf-scores. Hence, any analysis that uses absolute differences of this score will be highly skewed toward the very frequent words while the tf-idf-score is reaching its peak at the medium frequent words. Meanwhile, the z-score does not discriminate between frequent and unfrequent words. In fact, its mean is zero by definition."
Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988-fig7,"Comparison of the tf-idf-score, the tf-score and the z-score of ihre (63rd mfw), Pfarrer (378th mfw), and eigenes (1247th mfw). While the tf-idf-score is low for the frequent and the unfrequent words ihre and eigenes it is high for the medium frequent word Pfarrer which is very distinct for certain texts. In comparison, the term frequency of ihre is much higher for almost all novellas than for the other terms. With the z-score, these differences are balanced out by design."
Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988-fig8,"We compare pairwise distances of the 500 mfw for the three novellas of Kleist, Lohmann, and Traun. To make distances comparable we show the discrepancy to the mean in units of standard deviation (i.e. z-scores of distances). For cosine distance, Kleist and Lohmann are closest whereas Lohmann and Traun are far apart. For Burrows’s Delta the novellas of Kleist and Lohmann are far apart and Traun and Kleist have the smallest distance. Finally, for quadratic delta, the distance of Lohmann and Traun is larger than the one of Kleist and Lohmann."

Edge thickness indicates the rank of the neighbor among the closest novellas. For comparison, we highlighted an apparent group from the lower right (cosine similarity of z-scores) in all backbones; this mystery group is discussed at the end of the section."
Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities-988-fig11,"Backbones based on tf-idf-scores where highlighted nodes represent Adelsnovellen (novellas involving nobility). They tend to cluster if larger deviations in single entries are emphasized, which δ1 does not.

(a) The projector sends light patterns to the fingerprint; given the location of each stripe and of the corresponding distorted projection, the full 3-D model is recovered. (b) The 3-D fingerprint is hit by a laser beam and the signal response is captured by the camera; the exact position of the camera and the source allows to recover the exact 3-D location of each point. (c) More than two cameras are positioned at different angles around the fingerprint and shoot simultaneously; the reconstruction is possible given the exact spatial location of the cameras and their correspondingly matching spatial points. (d) The light beam emitted by the source penetrates the finger skin; the location of the mirror is in equal path from the beam splitter as the location of the finger. The beam splitter separates the input light beam into a component that is reflected to the mirror and another that hits the finger. The light reflected from the mirror (dashed line) and the finger (dotted line) is collected by the detector. (e) An ultrasonic pulse is transmitted by a transducer against the finger that is placed over the scanner; the pulse can be absorbed or reflected to the scanner, depending on the fingerprint structure. (f) Multiple 2-D fingerprint images are acquired from a fixed viewpoint/camera under different illumination sources (LEDs)."

The initial digitization outputs the object geometry, the reflectance characteristics in terms of an OctreeBTF [27]. Then, a pre-processing step (upper center) computes a version of the geometry suitable for 3D printing and converts the BTF data into a streamable version that is loaded by a server (bottom center). The server then streams the compressed OctreeBTF to remote clients who can interactively inspect the object in VR, enhanced by haptic feedback provided by the 3D printed replica of the object.

										Of love; where the regret of dark memory
										Drinks: it is a former happiness that shines

										Noble in his cold dale where the chest speaks

									The heavens in desires, it rains. This frail
										bird
										Would slide a wary shark, he flees the
										hail:
										Medallion, love him tenderly: he is great.
									
										
								The sweet liquors do not make his nostril

										It rains in the bell, the sea on his chest,

										There is no space where there is no

										One cannot serve two masters at once: obstacle

										One must avoid reducing war to slavery.
										Despair without form is only memory of
										glory.
										If you want sensuality, prepare for
										laughter.
										If happiness leads to time, it's because
										happiness is only ignorance.
										Grace is the distance man places between sin
										and feeling.
										Freedom is the gift of youth, oblivion the gift
										of age.
										Oblivion gives truth the taste of pleasure and
										sensuality takes it away.
										It is easier to tolerate pleasure than sin.

                        of various types that deliver excerpts of text that mirror print sources —
                        even the hyphens are retained. The most important contributions of the TLG

                        lines of the 
                     Odyssey available in the Perseus Digital Library. First, documents in this
                        collection have markup illustrating their logical contents: thus, where
                        incunabular systems can only recognize the physical page divisions, the
                        knowledge base allows the digital library system to recognize for dictionary
                        words in the LSJ Greek-English lexicon the many separate entries that appear
                        within a single page or that begin on one page and end on another. Second,
                        the primary source citations have been automatically analyzed and encoded.
                        Thus, the system can take a chunk of Greek, recognize what lines it
                        contains, and then locate dictionary entries (or commentaries,
                        encyclopedias, articles etc.) that refer to the lines in the chunk
                        displayed. In a mature digital library, citations from one text to another
                        become bi-directional links, allowing readers not only to follow the
                        documents that a particular work cites, but also to find works that
                        subsequently cite the document that they are viewing. Third — and perhaps
                        most importantly, morphological knowledge has been represented in machine
                        actionable form. Thus, an automated system is able to recognize that the

                     representations express relations of surrogates to originals; (2) through
                     database structure and metadata, surrogates are placed in relation to each
                     other, i.e., they establish an internal order; (3) functionality and
                     interaction design embodied in the interface establish a program of relations
                     of surrogates to users, i.e., they create an intermediating dynamics between
                     the affordances and constraints of the archive and its actual uses."

                     determine choices concerning digital remediation in terms of both format and
                     metadata (B1, B2). The order of the archive is based on this representational
                     tension between some sort of agreed material and textual correspondence to an
                     external order (A) and the reconfigurative difference of its processibility and

                     relations in the originals (A1, A2) are translated into material and textual
                     relations in the surrogates (B1, B2). Translation takes place at the material
                     level of transcoding (adoption of specific digital standards and formats for
                     generating text, image, audio, and video files, including transcoding between
                     earlier and current digital formats) and at the metadata level of textual
                     description and classification. The archive order is a multilayered documentary

                     structures and forms."

                  Correspondences between external and internal orders of the archive as
                        reflected in the file-naming system: the first sequence of initial
                     letters preceding the dot serves to identify the archival source of the
                     original document from which digital versions were obtained. The second
                     sequence of letters is used to identify the author of the work (in the case of
                     works with multiple authorship, authors’ identifiers are separated by dots).
                     The third letter sequence contains the initials of the work’s title (followed
                     by a number if there is more than one digital representation of the same work).
                     Sequences of digits that follow the letters identify the relative order of
                     derivation of digital objects when files with variable resolutions are created
                     from the same matrix. The final extension identifies the file type (.tif, .jpg,
                     .pdf, .mpg, .mov, .flv, etc.). Each file name situates the object within the
                     ecology of the archive and traces its origin to a media source outside the
                     digital archive. "

                        entry represents a performance at the Theatre Royal–Drury Lane
                            (DL) on Saturday, October 14, 1752. The main play
                        performed was The Beggar’s Opera, a ballad
                        opera by John Gay that was popular throughout the century. The cast list is
                        provided, showing that, for example, the leading role of Macheath was played
                        by an actor named Beard. The description of the hornpipe and country dance
                        featured in this performance are assumed to come from the newspaper
                        advertisement or playbill on which this entry is based. Queen Mab is the title of the afterpiece, a shorter
                        entertainment that would have been performed after the conclusion of The Beggar’s Opera. As 12
                        Oct. indicates that a cast list is provided in the advertisement
                        but omitted here because it is identical to the one that appears in an entry
                        for a performance two days earlier. (See Note 8 for additional information
                        on the abbreviation of cast lists in The London
                            Stage.) An additional dance performance titled Matelot Basque was featured. The theater sold
                        approximately £100 worth of tickets that evening, according to the receipt
                        book maintained by prompter Richard Cross."

                                    datan desde hace 20,000. Los Goruagal vivieron en Fig Tree

                  (S1, S2, S3). Within each setting, the row at the bottom depicts the final
                  setting of the data. Setting 1 (only one row) does not require test sets,
                  Setting 2 (only one row) aims at finding alteration candidates in texts with
                  no alterations. For Setting 3, the process of creating the setting is
                  depicted in multiple rows. First, only documents that contain alterations
                  are chosen. Then, each individual document is shuffled and split into a
                  training and a test part.

dhq-602,dhq-602-f01,"Diagram of the fundamental communication pattern in REST. The machine on the
                  left, known as the 
               client, makes a request for a resource. The machine on
                  the right, called the server, responds to the client’s request. The
                  language used between the computers is known as HTTP."
dhq-602,dhq-602-f02,"First REST principle: every resource that a server makes available must have a
                  name. One resource that the TIS-API makes available is the catalog of texts that
                  Tesserae has access to, which can be accessed by the name 
               /texts/.
                  Furthermore, metadata for each text in the catalog can also be requested.
                  Therefore, the TIS-API assigns a name to each resource. In the example figure, the
                  name “0” is associated with Aeneid, the name 1
                  is associated with Bellum Civile, and so forth. Note
                  that these example names are not the ones used in the actual deployment currently
                  running through the Tesserae project."
dhq-602,dhq-602-f03,"Second REST principle: requests should behave similarly across resources. In
                  this example, the client has requested a resource named 
               /texts/a. In
                  response, the server provides information on a. When the client requests
                  for a resource named /texts/b, the server responds in a similar fashion,
                  except that it provides information on b instead of on a."
dhq-602,dhq-602-f04,"Third REST principle: modifications to a resource are mediated through
                  instructions, known as a representation. When a client requests that a Tesserae
                  search be run, the TIS-API modifies the 
               parallels resource by appending
                  newly found intertexts. What intertexts should be added to “parallels” is
                  determined by the representation that the client sent (shown as the blue icon),
                  which contains instructions specifying how the search is to be run."
dhq-602,dhq-602-f05,"Fourth REST principle: representations should be self-descriptive. Although the
                  TIS-API is not strict in following this principle, one way in which it practices
                  the spirit of this principle is in the server response to a request for search
                  results. The representation used in submitting the current search (shown as the
                  blue icon) is given as part of the server’s response.
               "
dhq-602,dhq-602-f06,"Fifth REST principle: application state should not be stored in the API. In the
                  example of running a Tesserae search, the application is expected to 1) run a
                  search as specified and 2) display the results. The TIS-API separates these two
                  states of the application into individual requests, thereby avoiding the need to
                  store application state either on the client or the server. Instead, the
                  application state is mediated by representation: the client knows how to request
                  search results based on information the server has given (shown as the red icon).
                  Note that the client is not required to immediately request search results;
                  because it is not tied to an application state, it can make other requests, such
                  as requests for certain texts or for a new stopwords list, before requesting the
                  search results.

                     has been the most popular proverb on Twitter since 2016, perhaps originating from its
                     consistent use by Senator Bernie Sanders . It has since become associated
                     with growing protests against police brutality and gun violence. Annotations reflect
                     widely reported violent events and protests (with the exception of the 2018 US midterm
                     elections). The stark simplicity of this sixteenth century proverb evokes a narrative of
                     repetition past the point of tolerance . In this instance, beginning as a
                     condemnation of the continued reaffirmation of the status quo in US politics by Senator
                     Sanders, it is now popular as collective outcry against political inaction in the wake
                     of regular mass shootings in the US, and a lack of accountability in the killing of
                     black Americans by police. The changing significance and popularity of the proverb in
                     the past decade displays the aptitude of proverbial speech to be successfully employed
                     in varying contexts, and its potential to illustrate narrative commonalities between

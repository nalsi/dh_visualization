Left to right shows noise-like processes (a, d, and g), random walks obtained from the noise-like processes (b, e, and h), and, finally, estimation of the Hurst exponent for matching process (c, f, and i). Many cultural processes are noise-like (a, d, and g), but to estimate the Hurst exponent it is necessary to transform them to random walks through first-order integration (see Appendix A, equation (4)). In most cases, we are therefore not studying the process directly, but its incremental structure (b, e, and h). The behavior of the process (anti-persistent, short-term, and persistent) can often be observed at the initial plot (a, d, and g). The anti-persistent process (a) oscillates rapidly around its average at F(X) = 0, and short-memory process (b) contains short wave-like spikes. The persistent process (c) on the other hand contains copies of itself across multiple timescales. The last feature is an expression of self-similarity, which becomes more apparent for the persistent random walk process (h), where rounded mountain-like structures are embedded in the process at short, medium, and long timescales. The degree of self-similarity in a process can be estimated by AFA (c, f, and i) (see Appendix A, equations (5–6)), where a line is fitted to the residuals F(w) of the detrended process over multiple timescales or windows w. The Hurst parameter H is estimated as the slope of the linear fit and describes how fast the overall average amplitude F(w) grows with increasing window size w. For the anti-persistent process, the slope <0.5, for the process with only short-range correlations (i.e. short memory), it is approximately 0.5, and for the persistent process, the slope is >0.5. Notice that a linear fit is not a very accurate description of the anti-persistent process (c), which at short timescales (w < 16) is steeper, while at longer timescale (w ≥16) is more flat. This is an indication of a multi-fractal process. In this example, the process still remains anti-persistent because the slope is <0.5 at both timescales"

(a) The projector sends light patterns to the fingerprint; given the location of each stripe and of the corresponding distorted projection, the full 3-D model is recovered. (b) The 3-D fingerprint is hit by a laser beam and the signal response is captured by the camera; the exact position of the camera and the source allows to recover the exact 3-D location of each point. (c) More than two cameras are positioned at different angles around the fingerprint and shoot simultaneously; the reconstruction is possible given the exact spatial location of the cameras and their correspondingly matching spatial points. (d) The light beam emitted by the source penetrates the finger skin; the location of the mirror is in equal path from the beam splitter as the location of the finger. The beam splitter separates the input light beam into a component that is reflected to the mirror and another that hits the finger. The light reflected from the mirror (dashed line) and the finger (dotted line) is collected by the detector. (e) An ultrasonic pulse is transmitted by a transducer against the finger that is placed over the scanner; the pulse can be absorbed or reflected to the scanner, depending on the fingerprint structure.

The initial digitization outputs the object geometry, the reflectance characteristics in terms of an OctreeBTF [27]. Then, a pre-processing step (upper center) computes a version of the geometry suitable for 3D printing and converts the BTF data into a streamable version that is loaded by a server (bottom center). The server then streams the compressed OctreeBTF to remote clients who can interactively inspect the object in VR, enhanced by haptic feedback provided by the 3D printed replica of the object.

The digitized assets are processed using the Handwritten Text Recognition software developed by Transkribus [1] in order to make the content of the assets text-searchable. The project's second aim is to create a KG of entities mentioned within all those digitized assets (1). The relationships, scope, and granularity go beyond what is contained in these assets (e.g., via completion with additional research). Within the project, the NLP pipeline will extract and reconcile entities within documents to populate the spreadsheets (input schemas), which will then be transformed into triples for the KG.

Knowledge engineer are responsible for the R2RML mappings to transform CSV files into RDF and the knowledge organization and knowledge management of the KG."

							The Spectacle of Happiness
									
										
									There is a countryside king where a shadow
										flower rolls
										Simply hanging in the shadows pâtés
										Of love; where the regret of dark memory
										Drinks: it is a former happiness that shines
										sideways.
									
										
									A noble demon, hatred dark and size black,
										His tongue bathing in the ginger-white
										ravine,
										Rains; he leans in the shade, under the
										lustrous fabric,
										Noble in his cold dale where the chest speaks
										falsely.
									
										
									The heavens in desires, it rains. This frail
										bird
										Would slide a wary shark, he flees the
										hail:
										Medallion, love him tenderly: he is great.
									
										
								The sweet liquors do not make his nostril
										stomp;
										It rains in the bell, the sea on his chest,
										Wary. He has noble skies in the slow
										gladiolus.

								There is no rhythm where there is no form.

										One must not let go of the earth for

										There is no space where there is no

										One cannot serve two masters at once: obstacle

										One must avoid reducing war to slavery.
										Despair without form is only memory of

										If you want sensuality, prepare for

										If happiness leads to time, it's because
										happiness is only ignorance.
										Grace is the distance man places between sin
										and feeling.
										Freedom is the gift of youth, oblivion the gift
										of age.
										Oblivion gives truth the taste of pleasure and
										sensuality takes it away.
										It is easier to tolerate pleasure than sin.

								was following Crowther's lead when he implemented the light source

                        classical Greek texts. First begun in 1972, the TLG provides word searches
                        of various types that deliver excerpts of text that mirror print sources —
                        even the hyphens are retained. The most important contributions of the TLG
                        are (1) very accurate transcriptions of the text (without textual notes,
                        introduction, indices etc.) and (2) encoding one canonical citation scheme
                        by which scholars cite these sources. Incunabular systems have themselves
                        evolved. Storage has grown so much less expensive (by one measure, at least
                        300,000 times cheaper

                           below. The TLG was founded ten years earlier, in 1972, when disk storage

                        page images of the original are available. The representative of one
                        national library asserted that it would not even accept collections of

"7408",7408,103,"dhq-23","dhq-23-f04","resources/images/figure04.jpg","The figure above illustrates some of the information about the opening
                        lines of the 
                     Odyssey available in the Perseus Digital Library. First, documents in this
                        collection have markup illustrating their logical contents: thus, where
                        incunabular systems can only recognize the physical page divisions, the
                        knowledge base allows the digital library system to recognize for dictionary
                        words in the LSJ Greek-English lexicon the many separate entries that appear
                        within a single page or that begin on one page and end on another. Second,
                        the primary source citations have been automatically analyzed and encoded.
                        Thus, the system can take a chunk of Greek, recognize what lines it
                        contains, and then locate dictionary entries (or commentaries,
                        encyclopedias, articles etc.) that refer to the lines in the chunk
                        displayed. In a mature digital library, citations from one text to another
                        become bi-directional links, allowing readers not only to follow the
                        documents that a particular work cites, but also to find works that
                        subsequently cite the document that they are viewing. Third — and perhaps
                        most importantly, morphological knowledge has been represented in machine
                        actionable form. Thus, an automated system is able to recognize that the
                        string ἔννεπε is a form associated with the dictionary entry ἐνίσπω."

                            1660-1800 (Avery et al 1960-68, Part 4, Vol. 1, p. 325). This
                        entry represents a performance at the Theatre Royal–Drury Lane
                            (DL) on Saturday, October 14, 1752. The main play
                        performed was The Beggar’s Opera, a ballad
                        opera by John Gay that was popular throughout the century. The cast list is
                        provided, showing that, for example, the leading role of Macheath was played
                        by an actor named Beard. The description of the hornpipe and country dance
                        featured in this performance are assumed to come from the newspaper
                        advertisement or playbill on which this entry is based. Queen Mab is the title of the afterpiece, a shorter
                        entertainment that would have been performed after the conclusion of The Beggar’s Opera. As 12
                        Oct. indicates that a cast list is provided in the advertisement
                        but omitted here because it is identical to the one that appears in an entry
                        for a performance two days earlier. (See Note 8 for additional information
                        on the abbreviation of cast lists in The London
                            Stage.) An additional dance performance titled Matelot Basque was featured. The theater sold
                        approximately £100 worth of tickets that evening, according to the receipt
                        book maintained by prompter Richard Cross."

                                    aborigen y un marinero inglés. Hay siete hijos de esta unión

                                    padre de la misma manera como de los colonos de la región de

                                    que se rumora ser sarampión que ha eliminado a una gran
                                    cantidad’. Hay algunos casos de blancos viviendo con mujeres

                  letters addressed to An. Chamisso. There are two consecutive outliers with
                  significantly higher numbers of alteration words. One is part of the training set,
                  one is part of the test set, the temporal proximity may indicate a content-related
                  proximity that the model was able to capture.

                  left, known as the 
               client, makes a request for a resource. The machine on
                  the right, called the server, responds to the client’s request. The
                  language used between the computers is known as HTTP."
"11066",11066,3761,"dhq-602","dhq-602-f02","resources/images/figure2.png","First REST principle: every resource that a server makes available must have a
                  name. One resource that the TIS-API makes available is the catalog of texts that
                  Tesserae has access to, which can be accessed by the name 
               /texts/.
                  Furthermore, metadata for each text in the catalog can also be requested.
                  Therefore, the TIS-API assigns a name to each resource. In the example figure, the
                  name “0” is associated with Aeneid, the name 1
                  is associated with Bellum Civile, and so forth. Note
                  that these example names are not the ones used in the actual deployment currently
                  running through the Tesserae project."
"11067",11067,3762,"dhq-602","dhq-602-f03","resources/images/figure3.png","Second REST principle: requests should behave similarly across resources. In
                  this example, the client has requested a resource named 
               /texts/a. In
                  response, the server provides information on a. When the client requests
                  for a resource named /texts/b, the server responds in a similar fashion,
                  except that it provides information on b instead of on a."
"11068",11068,3763,"dhq-602","dhq-602-f04","resources/images/figure4.png","Third REST principle: modifications to a resource are mediated through
                  instructions, known as a representation. When a client requests that a Tesserae
                  search be run, the TIS-API modifies the 
               parallels resource by appending
                  newly found intertexts. What intertexts should be added to “parallels” is
                  determined by the representation that the client sent (shown as the blue icon),
                  which contains instructions specifying how the search is to be run."
"11069",11069,3764,"dhq-602","dhq-602-f05","resources/images/figure5.png","Fourth REST principle: representations should be self-descriptive. Although the
                  TIS-API is not strict in following this principle, one way in which it practices
                  the spirit of this principle is in the server response to a request for search
                  results. The representation used in submitting the current search (shown as the
                  blue icon) is given as part of the server’s response.

"11070",11070,3765,"dhq-602","dhq-602-f06","resources/images/figure6.png","Fifth REST principle: application state should not be stored in the API. In the
                  example of running a Tesserae search, the application is expected to 1) run a
                  search as specified and 2) display the results. The TIS-API separates these two
                  states of the application into individual requests, thereby avoiding the need to
                  store application state either on the client or the server. Instead, the
                  application state is mediated by representation: the client knows how to request
                  search results based on information the server has given (shown as the red icon).
                  Note that the client is not required to immediately request search results;
                  because it is not tied to an application state, it can make other requests, such
                  as requests for certain texts or for a new stopwords list, before requesting the
                  search results.

                        modelling of 6628 interviews as a Markovian dynamic system. A, a single interview is
                        processed into 1 minute segments that are assigned to topic terms each (color-coded).
                        Interviews are therefore represented as sequences of consecutive topics (or narrative
                        pathways). B The whole interview corpus consists of 6628 interviews that are converted
                        into 6628 series of topic terms. B, Transition matrix that summarises the probabilities
                        of hearing about a given topic following another topic as learned from all available
                        interviews. The transition matrix can also be represented as a directed graph; nodes are
                        the topics and the edge weights are the probabilities that an interviewee move from one
                        topic to another, it therefore stores all possible narrative trajectories that a
                        recalling of Auschwitz can follow in the corpus of all interviews. D. The “busiest” (or
                        the most prevalent) narrative pathways obtained by means of Transition path theory
                        (TPT). TPT extracts prevalent narrations from the MSM transition matrix; a narration is
                        here depicted as a (possibly non-linear) sequence of topics that goes from left to

                     popularity of enough is enough on Twitter grew steadily over the last decade, and it
                     has been the most popular proverb on Twitter since 2016, perhaps originating from its
                     consistent use by Senator Bernie Sanders . It has since become associated
                     with growing protests against police brutality and gun violence. Annotations reflect
                     widely reported violent events and protests (with the exception of the 2018 US midterm
                     elections). The stark simplicity of this sixteenth century proverb evokes a narrative of
                     repetition past the point of tolerance . In this instance, beginning as a
                     condemnation of the continued reaffirmation of the status quo in US politics by Senator
                     Sanders, it is now popular as collective outcry against political inaction in the wake
                     of regular mass shootings in the US, and a lack of accountability in the killing of
                     black Americans by police. The changing significance and popularity of the proverb in
                     the past decade displays the aptitude of proverbial speech to be successfully employed
                     in varying contexts, and its potential to illustrate narrative commonalities between
